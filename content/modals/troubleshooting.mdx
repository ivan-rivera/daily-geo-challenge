If you are having trouble with the app, then the first thing you might like to do is reset your browser cache. If this does not work, then please submit a GitGub issue [here](https://github.com/ivan-rivera/daily-geo-challenge/issues/new). It would be helpful if you could take a screenshot of the problem and include it in the issue. Alternatively, you can submit feedback on the last page of this app, which should become available once you finish all the questions.
