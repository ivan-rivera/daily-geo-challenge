This app was authored by a web development hobbyist for the sake of public entertainment and education. With that in mind, the app is free (and will always be free) and without ads. However, given that it's a hobby project, it's not perfect. If you find any bugs or have any suggestions, please feel free to either contact me or raise an issue on GitHub.
