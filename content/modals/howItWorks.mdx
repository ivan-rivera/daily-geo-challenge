A set of questions get sampled from a database of world facts derived from Wikidata Query Service (WDQS). Wikidata can be accessed [here](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page) and the query service can be accessed [here](https://query.wikidata.org/). The questions get refreshed every 24 hours. Every one sees the same questions in the same order. Once enough people submit their answers, performance statistics are calculated and displayed. These statistics are gathered for each question (so that you do not need to complete the whole quiz to contribute to the stats) and for the entire quiz. Once you complete the quiz, you can share your results with your friends ahd challenge them to beat your score.
